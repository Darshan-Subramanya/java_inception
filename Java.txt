Java is a programming language designed to build secure, powerful applications that run across multiple operating systems, including Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. The Java language is known to be flexible, scalable, and maintainable.

A java file will always contain a class. Inside the class there will a  main function (compulsary if you are run the file).
E.g. public class Arithmetic {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
    }}
You can create Arthimetic class object inside the main class.
System.out.println("Aanisha Mishra"); //to print to the console
Boolean values are true and false.
Basic Data Types: int, char, boolean.

Whitespace is one or more characters (such as a space, tab, enter, or return) that do not produce a visible mark or text. Whitespace is often used to make code visually presentable. 

Java supports single line comments (//) and multi-line comments (/* */)
Java has usual relational operators ( < > <= >= ).

 Java programs can follow different sets of instructions depending on the values that we provide to them. This is called control flow.

(&& and), (|| or), (! not) operator while performing condition check.
Evaluation precedence: ! > && > ||

Java supports if, if else, if else if else as cpp.
Syntax for switch is same as cpp.

Java is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, which means that we can design classes, objects, and methods that can perform certain actions.
Constructor Syntax: public ClassName(params){}
Variables declared inside class are called instance variables.

Creating instance of class: ClassName instanceName = new ClassName(params);
Method declaration: public/private returntype methodname(params){}
